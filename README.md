# Code & Data Processing Walkthrough

In this section, I'll describe what my (often Python-scripted) MCNP inputs do and how I processed the MCNP outputs to obtain the data I got. I'll go folder-by-folder.

## B8 Fiducial - Flux

### MCNP Input File: 
[`b8_caseR_rings5_d2o96-8_RaBe.inp`](</B8 Fiducial - Flux/b8_caseR_rings5_d2o96-8_RaBe.inp>)

The following `SDEF` card defines a Radon-Beryllium source. It is modeled as a point source, located at `(0, 0, 62)` of the MCNP model (center of the B8). It has a distribution of emitted neutron energies `d1` defined by the energy bins in MeV in `si1` and the probability of each bin in `sp1`, e.g., no neutrons < 0.316 MeV, 0.347% between 0.316 MeV to 0.398 MeV, etc. This data is from the [IAEA <i>Compendium of Neutron Spectra</i> (1990), p.79](inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/21/092/21092101.pdf). 
```
sdef  pos= 0 0 62  erg=d1  par=n
si1  0.316   0.398   0.501   0.631   0.794   1.00    1.26
     1.58    2.00    2.51    3.16    3.98    5.01    6.31
     7.94   10.0    12.6 
sp1     0    3.47e-3 2.66e-3 1.65e-3 2.03e-3 1.06e-2 2.75e-2 
     5.19e-2 6.55e-2 7.31e-2 9.95e-2 1.64e-1 1.78e-1 1.21e-1
     1.41e-1 5.71e-2 1.39e-3 
```

Having defined our RaBe source, this `F4` tally card meaures the volume flux per source neutron in the heavy water (material `1100`) + all the fuel cubes (mats `2001`-`6024`).
```
fc14 n flux in hwtr + fuel
f14:n (1100 2001 2002 2003 2004
            ...
            6023 6024)
```

This `NPS` card states we will run the calculation with `1e6` source neutrons emitted from our RaBe source. The `F4` tally normalizes results to be per 1 source neutron anyways, so bigger the `NPS` the better fidelity. Then, you can manually scale your flux to the real number of neutrons being emitted by the RaBe source per second, if you know its activity (which we do not for the B8).
```
nps 1e6
```

This `KCODE` card calculates $k_\text{eff}$ with 200,000 source neutrons (this time the source of neutrons being the coordinates of the centers of each fuel cube in `KSRC`), 115 active cycles, and 15 discarded cycles (giving time for the neutron population to converge). I commented it out (`c`) because I had calculated $k_\text{eff}$ in Case R of the other B8 Fiducial folder, but you can also uncomment this and run it yourself.
```
c kcode 200000 1 15 115
```

### MCNP Output File: 
[`o_b8_caseR_rings5_d2o96-8_RaBe.o`](</B8 Fiducial - Flux/o_b8_caseR_rings5_d2o96-8_RaBe.o>)

The `F4` tally results can be found by searching for "`1tally       14`":
```
1tally       14        nps =     1000000

      total      2.26368E-03 0.0027
```

We have energy bins, the neutron flux tallied within each energy range, and the error. We just copy this into a `.csv` and plot it in Excel (or Python matplotlib).

## B8 Fiducial - k_eff - Sensitivty Analyses

This is where understanding my code gets a little tricky, because I wrote a huge Python wrapper to automate writing + processing MCNP for me. I don't think anyone will really use my code anyways, but I'll write it out just as due diligence.

Here's the folders in this directory:
- [./Figures/](</B8 Fiducial - k_eff - Sensitivity/Figures>) - For data processing. I don't have any scripts that touch this folder.
- [./MCNP/](</B8 Fiducial - k_eff - Sensitivity/MCNP>) - Where my Python wrapper writes MCNP inputs and stores MCNP outputs + the `temp`orary directory for when MCNP is actively writing. You should not have to touch anything in here unless MCNP throws an error, in which case you need to go in and manually delete the erroneous input or output (failsafe to prevent any unintentional overwrites).
- [./Results/](</B8 Fiducial - k_eff - Sensitivity/Results>) - Where the CSVs collating results get written.
- [./Source/](</B8 Fiducial - k_eff - Sensitivity/Source>) - Where my Python wrapper scripts and MCNP templates are kept. If you just want to replicate my data exactly, you shouldn't need to touch this folder. If you want to tweak certain parts of my sensitivity analysis, e.g., test criticality at an even lower moderator purity, then you only need to touch `Parameters.py`

I'll now try to walk through executing my code and what happens under the hood.

### Executing the Python Wrapper

Ideally, executing this all is relatively simple (duh, that's the point of scripting everything, except for the 7,621 times it breaks!). In your terminal, `cd` to this directory and use:
```sh
python B8Analysis.py -r <run_type> -t <tasks>
```

You have three options for `<run_type>` or 'cases':

- `A`: perturb U cube density
- `B`: perturb D2O mol% purity (remainder as H2O)
- `J`: I have legacy data about case J where I elongate the cubes of chains from (9 + 8) to (10 + 9).
- `R`: reference fiducial cases 

(When I was really deep in the trenches, I actually had `A` through `S`)

The `<tasks>` is the number of logical processors you have on your computer. You can leave the `-t` argument empty, and `B8Analysis.py` will check how many you have for you.

Let's say we want to perturb the U cube density, so we use `run_type = A`, and I have 32 logical processors :
```sh
python B8Analysis.py -r A -t 32
```



### What the Wrapper Does: MCNP Input Processing

**Step 1**

Now that we've executed run type `A`, from `B8Analysis.py`, we then read the `FUEL_DENSITIES` we want to test from `Parameters.py`. 

```py
elif run_type == 'A':
    for fuel_density in FUEL_DENSITIES:
      current_run = Sensitivity(run_type,
                                tasks,
                                print_input=check_mcnp,
                                fuel_density=fuel_density)
```

This then populates the `Sensitivity` class in `MCNP_Output.py`:
```py
class Sensitivity(MCNP_File):
```
which has a `MCNP_File` class defined in `MCNP_Input.py`:
```py
class MCNP_File:
    def __init__(self,run_type,tasks,
               print_input=True, 
               delete_extensions=['.s'],  # default: '.s'
               r_tank=TANK_RADIUS, #  61.7 cm
               h_tank=TANK_HEIGHT, # 124.0 cm
               n_rings=5,
               [...] )
```

**Step 2**

`MCNP_Input.py` is where the bulk of the scripting occurs. In the `MCNP_File` class, we first define, calculate, etc. all of the necessary physical parameters. To do so, I also call several helper functions from `Utilities.py`. For example, we calculate the D2O density to program into the MCNP input, using the helper `d2o_temp_K_to_mass_density(d2o_temp_K)`:

```py
self.d2o_density = (1-0.01*self.d2o_void_percent)*d2o_temp_K_to_mass_density(d2o_temp_K)
```

where we set `d2o_temp_K` to the B8's ambient 11 C (`AMBIENT_TEMP_K = 284` in `Parameters.py`).  

**Step 3**

Then, we use the physical constants to write code chunks in MCNP syntax. For instance, we need to call the necessary cross section libraries for particle transport in the moderator. Like described in the paper, we want to perform temperature interpolation. So in `MCNP_Input.py` we run the function `find_xs_libs()`:

```py
def find_xs_libs(self):
  self.d2o_mats_interpolated_str = wtr_interpolate_mat(self.d2o_temp_K, d2o_atom_percent=self.d2o_purity)
```

which calls `wtr_interpolate_mat()` from `Utilities.py`:

```py
def wtr_interpolate_mat(temp_K, d2o_atom_percent=0):
  [...]
  return wtr_mats_interpolated
```

For a given temperature in Kelvin `temp_K`, this function performs pseudomaterial interpolation for a water mixture of D2O and H2O. Mathematically, this interpolation is represented as the following. For desired temperature $T$ bracketed by two xs libraries of temperatures $T_L < T < T_H$, the fraction of atoms associated with the lower temperature is:

```math
f_L = \frac{\sqrt{T_H}-\sqrt{T}}{\sqrt{T_H}-\sqrt{T_L}},
```

and the fraction of the higher-temperature library is $f_H = 1 - f_L$ such that the total cross section $\Sigma$ of the nuclide is evaluated as:

```math
\Sigma(T) = f_L \cdot \Sigma(T_L) + f_H \cdot \Sigma(T_H).
```

Let's run `wtr_interpolate_mat()` by itself (just execute `Utilities.py` itself) to see how $f_L$ and $f_H$ get calculated:
```py
>>> wtr_interpolate_mat(294, d2o_atom_percent=100)
"1002.00c 2.00    8016.00c 1.00"
>>> wtr_interpolate_mat(294, d2o_atom_percent=50)
"1001.00c 1.00    1002.00c 1.00    8016.00c 1.00"
>>> wtr_interpolate_mat(284, d2o_atom_percent=96.8)
"1001.06c 0.0141  1001.00c 0.0499    1002.06c 0.426529  1002.00c 1.509471  8016.00c 1.00"
```

In the first case of 100% D2O at 294 K (21 C), we can see that isotopes `1002` (D) and `8016` (O) have xs library `.00c` exactly at 294 K. So we get 2 deuterons at 294 K (`1002.00c 2.00`) and 1 oxygen atom at 294 K (`8016.00c 1.00`), i.e., D2O. 

In the second case of 50% D2O (and the other 50% H2O), we have 1/2 H2O + 1/2 D2O = 1 H (`1001`) + 1 D (`1002`) + 1 O (`8016`). 

The third case of 96.8% D2O + 3.2% H2O at 284 K (11 C) is the card we need for the fiducial B8. Each isotope is split proportionally between the two closest xs libraries (`.00c` at 294 K and `.06c` at 250 K).

**Step 4**

We also create the names of our MCNP input and outputs so that its parameters are self-evident from the file name. To avoid any processing issues, we replace any decimals with an underscore `_`.

```py
self.base_filename = f"{self.template_filepath.split('/')[-1].split('.')[0]}-case{self.run_type}"
if self.run_type in ['A','B']:
            self.input_filename = f"{self.base_filename}-d2o{'{:.1f}'.format(self.d2o_purity).replace('.','_')}-Urho{'{:.2f}'.format(self.fuel_density).replace('.','_')}.inp"
self.output_filename = f"o_{self.input_filename.split('.')[0]}.out"
```

Some examples of `self.input_filename` and `self.output_filename` are:
```sh
b8-caseA-d2o96_8-Urho15_00.inp
b8-caseA-d2o96_8-Urho19_25.inp
b8-caseB-d2o85_0-Urho18_53.inp
b8-caseB-d2o100_0-Urho18_53.inp

o_b8-caseA-d2o96_8-Urho15_00.out
o_b8-caseA-d2o96_8-Urho19_25.out
o_b8-caseB-d2o85_0-Urho18_53.out
o_b8-caseB-d2o100_0-Urho18_53.out
```

We can read that case `A` keeps the moderator purity constant at the reference 96.8 mol% D2O while changing the fuel density, and vice versa for case `B`, just as God (yours truly) intended.

**Step 5**

Once we do that, we load everything into a dictionary `self.parameters`:
```py
self.parameters = {'datetime': self.datetime,
                   'run_type': self.run_type,
                   'r_tank' : self.r_tank,
                   'h_tank' : self.h_tank,
                   'n_rings': self.n_rings,
                   [...]
                   'h_h2o_sab_lib': self.h_h2o_sab_lib,
                   'd_d2o_sab_lib': self.d_d2o_sab_lib,}
```

it into the `b8.template` MCNP input template using the `Jinja2` package:

```py
if self.print_input:
    with open(self.template_filepath, 'r') as template_file:
        template_str = template_file.read()
        template = Template(template_str)
        template.stream(**self.parameters).dump(self.input_filepath)
```

**Step 6**

Now that the MCNP input file is written, `B8Analysis.py` then checks if you have mcnp (`check_mcnp` boolean) and if so, calls the function to run MCNP:
```py
elif run_type == 'A': # Uranium Density
    for fuel_density in FUEL_DENSITIES:
        current_run = Sensitivity(run_type, tasks,
                                  print_input=check_mcnp,
                                  fuel_density=fuel_density)
        if check_mcnp:
            current_run.run_mcnp()
```

where `run_mcnp()` is in `MCNP_Input.py`:

```py
def run_mcnp(self):
    if self.output_filename not in os.listdir(self.outputs_folder):
        cmd = f"""mcnp6 i="{self.input_filepath}" n="{self.user_temp_folder}/{self.output_filename.split('.')[0]}." tasks {self.tasks}"""
        os.system(cmd)
        self.mcnp_skipped = False
    else:
        self.mcnp_skipped = True
```

Notice that MCNP is writing outputs to a temporary `./MCNP/<run_type>/temp/` folder. After MCNP finishes, we then move the outputs to `./MCNP/<run_type>/outputs/` folder with `move_mcnp_files()` in `MCNP_Input.py`.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### What the Wrapper Does: MCNP Output Processing

**Step 7**

Once the MCNP run is completed, `B8Analysis.py` then moves the MCNP output file from the `/temp/` folder to the `/outputs/` folder. (This `/temp/` folder gets deleted and created again by `MCNP_Input.py` before the next MCNP input is run, so we just move the desired `.o` file out and the rest of the outputs we don't need gets trashed.)
```py
current_run.move_mcnp_files(output_types_to_move=['.o'])
current_run.process_keff()
```

**Step 8**

In `process_keff()`, located `MCNP_Output.py`, we then process the MCNP output file. It first sets up a CSV to collate all our results. It then calls `extract_keff()`, also in `MCNP_Output.py`, to read the output file to look for the calculated $k_\text{eff}$, its $\pm 1 \sigma$ uncertainty, and the thermal neutron fraction in the model. 

```py
def process_keff(self): # paraphrased for README.md

    self.keff_filename = f'{self.base_filename}-keff.csv'
    self.keff_filepath = f"{self.results_folder}/{self.keff_filename}"

    if self.run_type in ['A']:
        self.index_var, self.index_header, self.index_data = self.fuel_density, 'fuel density (g/cc)', FUEL_DENSITIES
    elif self.run_type in ['B']:
        self.index_var, self.index_header, self.index_data = self.d2o_purity, 'modr purity (mol%)', MODR_PURITIES

    print(f"\n  __MCNP_Output.py")
    self.extract_keff()

    df_keff.loc[self.index_var, "keff"] = self.keff
    df_keff.loc[self.index_var, "keff unc"] = self.keff_unc
    df_keff.loc[self.index_var, "therm n %"] = self.therm_n_frac

    df_keff.to_csv(self.keff_filepath, encoding='utf8')
```

Rinse and repeat Steps 1-8 until you ran and processed all the MCNP runs you want!

## B8 HCP Lattice - Criticality Optimization

This folder has the same structure as [./B8 Fiducial - k_eff - Sensitivity Analyses/](<./B8 Fiducial - k_eff - Sensitivity Analyses/>). I separated the two because writing the MCNP input for the HCP B8 required different template and calculations in MCNP_Input.py than the fiducial B8. *All code in this folder is fully standalone from ./B8 Fiducial - k_eff - Sensitivity Analyses/ and vice versa.*

You execute this code identically as `B8Analysis.py`, except now it's called `B8Optimize.py` just so you can differentiate it. In your terminal, `cd` to this directory and use:
```sh
python B8Optimize.py -r <run_type> -t <tasks>
```

You have one option for `<run_type>` (I am a generous god):

- `SC`: perturb moderator volume and number of cubes (set in Parameters.py)

(`SC` is just a holdover designation from before I cleaned up all the other different cases I decided not to publish.)

The `<tasks>` is the number of logical processors you have on your computer. You can leave the `-t` argument empty, and `B8Optimize.py` will check how many you have for you. I paid for 32 logical processors so I'm gonna use 32 logical processors:
```sh
python B8Optimize.py -r SC -t 32
```

Ride out the MCNP runs and collect the CSV of all the results in ./Result/SC/.

To make my `contourf` plot, you don't need to touch anything, just execute B8ContourPlot.py:

```sh
python B8ContourPlot.py
```

## B8 Unit Cell - k_inf

I drew the Unit Cell in my paper as a cylinder, but in the MCNP code it's actually a hexagonal prism (of equivalent Voronoi cross sectional area + volume). I just couldn't be bothered to draw a hexagon in SVG-Edit, which is the software I used to draw figures of the different B8 models. Same difference, though (honestly).
