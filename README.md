# Code & Data Processing Walkthrough

In this section, I'll describe what my (often Python-scripted) MCNP inputs do and how I processed the MCNP outputs to obtain the data I got. I'll go folder-by-folder.

## B8 Fiducial - Flux

### MCNP Input File: 
[`b8_caseR_rings5_d2o96-8_RaBe.inp`](</B8 Fiducial - Flux/b8_caseR_rings5_d2o96-8_RaBe.inp>)

The following `SDEF` card defines a Radon-Beryllium source. It is modeled as a point source, located at `(0, 0, 62)` of the MCNP model (center of the B8). It has a distribution of emitted neutron energies `d1` defined by the energy bins in MeV in `si1` and the probability of each bin in `sp1`, e.g., no neutrons < 0.316 MeV, 0.347% between 0.316 MeV to 0.398 MeV, etc. This data is from the [IAEA <i>Compendium of Neutron Spectra</i> (1990), p.79](inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/21/092/21092101.pdf). 
```
sdef  pos= 0 0 62  erg=d1  par=n
si1  0.316   0.398   0.501   0.631   0.794   1.00    1.26
     1.58    2.00    2.51    3.16    3.98    5.01    6.31
     7.94   10.0    12.6 
sp1     0    3.47e-3 2.66e-3 1.65e-3 2.03e-3 1.06e-2 2.75e-2 
     5.19e-2 6.55e-2 7.31e-2 9.95e-2 1.64e-1 1.78e-1 1.21e-1
     1.41e-1 5.71e-2 1.39e-3 
```

Having defined our RaBe source, this `F4` tally card meaures the volume flux per source neutron in the heavy water (material `1100`) + all the fuel cubes (mats `2001`-`6024`).
```
fc14 n flux in hwtr + fuel
f14:n (1100 2001 2002 2003 2004
            ...
            6023 6024)
```

This `NPS` card states we will run the calculation with `1e6` source neutrons emitted from our RaBe source. The `F4` tally normalizes results to be per 1 source neutron anyways, so bigger the `NPS` the better fidelity. Then, you can manually scale your flux to the real number of neutrons being emitted by the RaBe source per second, if you know its activity (which we do not for the B8).
```
nps 1e6
```

This `KCODE` card calculates $k_\text{eff}$ with 200,000 source neutrons (this time the source of neutrons being the coordinates of the centers of each fuel cube in `KSRC`), 115 active cycles, and 15 discarded cycles (giving time for the neutron population to converge). I commented it out (`c`) because I had calculated $k_\text{eff}$ in Case R of the other B8 Fiducial folder, but you can also uncomment this and run it yourself.
```
c kcode 200000 1 15 115
```

### MCNP Output File: 
[`o_b8_caseR_rings5_d2o96-8_RaBe.o`](</B8 Fiducial - Flux/o_b8_caseR_rings5_d2o96-8_RaBe.o>)

The `F4` tally results can be found by searching for "`1tally       14`":
```
1tally       14        nps =     1000000
+                                   n flux in hwtr + fuel

      total      2.26368E-03 0.0027
```

We have energy bins, the neutron flux tallied within each energy range, and the error. We just copy this into a `.csv` and plot it in Excel (or Python matplotlib).

## B8 Fiducial - k_eff - Sensitivty Analyses

This is where understanding my code gets a little tricky, because I wrote a huge Python wrapper to automate writing + processing MCNP for me. I don't think anyone will really use my code anyways, but I'll write it out just as due diligence.

Here's the folders in this directory:
- [./Figures/](</B8 Fiducial - k_eff - Sensitivity/Figures>) - For data processing. I don't have any scripts that touch this folder.
- [./MCNP/](</B8 Fiducial - k_eff - Sensitivity/MCNP>) - Where my Python wrapper writes MCNP inputs and stores MCNP outputs + the `temp`orary directory for when MCNP is actively writing. You should not have to touch anything in here unless MCNP throws an error, in which case you need to go in and manually delete the erroneous input or output (failsafe to prevent any unintentional overwrites).
- [./Results/](</B8 Fiducial - k_eff - Sensitivity/Results>) - Where the CSVs collating results get written.
- [./Source/](</B8 Fiducial - k_eff - Sensitivity/Source>) - Where my Python wrapper scripts and MCNP templates are kept. If you just want to replicate my data exactly, you shouldn't need to touch this folder. If you want to tweak certain parts of my sensitivity analysis, e.g., test criticality at an even lower moderator purity, then you only need to touch `Parameters.py`

I'll now try to walk through executing my code and what happens under the hood.

### Executing the Python Wrapper

Ideally, executing this all is relatively simple (duh, that's the point of scripting everything, except for the 7,621 times it breaks!). In your terminal, `cd` to this directory and use:
```
python B8Analysis.py -r <run_type> -t <tasks>
```

You have three options for `<run_type>` or 'cases':

- `A`: perturb U cube density
- `B`: perturb D2O mol% purity (remainder as H2O)
- `J`: I have legacy data about case J where I elongate the cubes of chains from (9 + 8) to (10 + 9).
- `R`: reference fiducial cases 

(When I was really deep in the trenches, I actually had `A` through `S`)

The `<tasks>` is the number of logical processors you have on your computer. You can leave the `-t` argument empty, and `B8Analysis.py` will check how many you have for you.

Let's say we want to perturb the U cube density, so we use `run_type = A`, and I have 32 logical processors :
```
python B8Analysis.py -r A -t 32
```



### What the Wrapper Does

Now that we've executed run type `A`, in `B8Analysis.py` 

```py
elif run_type == 'A':
    for fuel_density in FUEL_DENSITIES:
```
